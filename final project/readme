Color-Based Line Tracking Robot
This project implements an autonomous robot car using a Raspberry Pi camera and PiCar-4WD, capable of tracking color-coded paths and detecting stop signs using computer vision. It uses OpenCV for image processing and records the movement trajectory with optional visualization.

üîß Dependencies
Install required packages with:

pip install opencv-python numpy matplotlib picar-4wd
üé® Supported Colors (HSV)
Used for path tracking:

Orange

Blue

Purple

Used for stop sign detection:

Red (via two HSV ranges for red)

üö¶ Behavior Logi
Color Detection: Focuses on the bottom 30% of the image to identify the dominant color.

Direction Estimation:

Left of center ‚Üí turn_left()

Right of center ‚Üí turn_right()

Centered ‚Üí go_forward()

Stop Sign Detection: If the red area exceeds 5% of the image, the car stops.

Line Loss Handling: If the line is lost for too long, the robot pauses until it sees the line again.

Path Logging: Movement history is recorded and visualized using Matplotlib.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run
Make sure your camera and PiCar-4WD are connected and then run:

bash

python control.py
Press q to exit the program at any time.
